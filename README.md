## Business Goal:
Create a model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 

### Dataset

## Conclusions
- Based on the final model, the top 3 features contributing significantly towards
explaining the demand of the shared bikes are feeling temperature(atemp), yr and weather
- Most of the bikes are rented in fall.
- Users prefer to take bikes in clear or partly cloudy weather.
